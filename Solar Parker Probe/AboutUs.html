    On the way to the sun 
Obstacles of solar parker prove while reaching to the sun:
Large  amount of dust around the sun as expected:
  </h1>
  </p>
  <p>1)Space dust encountered  that could easily degrade materials and instruments, and intense light and high-speed particles escaping .</p>
  <p>2) The crushing pressure and heat also became the major challenge</p>
  <p>3) Angular momentum of a satellite was itself a challenge at the beginning.As venus contributed to solve the problem somehow.</p>
  <p>Parker Solar Probe designed, built and now operated at APL, does not carry a dust detector. But as dust grains pelt the spacecraft along its path, the high-velocity impacts create clouds of plasma. These clouds produce unique electrical charges that are picked up by several sensors on the probeâ€™s FIELDS instrument, which is designed to measure the electric and magnetic fields near the Sun. Mission scientists have used this data, for example, to construct comprehensive pictures of the structure and behavior of  large cloud dust that swirls around the solar system.</p>
