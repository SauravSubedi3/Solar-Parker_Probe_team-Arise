    <p>Parker solar probe is not an one day project, it tooks years of time and efforts. After the concept of this model
      many people didn't believe that this could ever be possible many people thought that it is impossible to touch the
      sun surface but the team didn't lose the hope and continued the project until they become confident about their
      projects and launched their and the rest is history that we all know today.

      Parker solar probe is not only the project for exploring the the sun but also the project that hold the hopes and
      belief of all those hardworking team. Today this greatest invention is all because of the hardwork, dedication,
      patience, curiosity, Endless efforts, team work and never ending hope created the world greatest and historical
      project to be possible. Even after the launched of parker solar probe, it faced many obstacles i.e different space
      weather phenomena that Parker encounters on its journey-including extreme temperatures, dust, the solar wind, and
      solar storms, by comparing one's with solar probe we can take lesson that life is like a space more deeper we go
      more dense it will. By relating our birth with the launched of solar probe we get lesson that life is full of
      struggle. It is some thing that is begin to find its destination even if many obstacles may we face we should have
      courage to fight against that obstacles and move on to find our destination even if it takes years of time and
      hardwork.</p>
