      <h1>How fast is solar parker probe?</h1>
      <p>It approaches to within 9.86 solar radii (6.9 million km or 4.3 million miles) from the center of the Sun, and
        by
        2025 it will travel, at closest approach, as fast as 690,000 km/h (430,000 mph), or 0.064% the speed of light.
        It
        is the fastest object ever built. At closest approach Parker Solar probe hurtles around the sun at approximately
        430,000mph. That's fast enough to get from philadelphia to Washington, D.C. in a second. Perils it had to deal
        or
        overcome to make this record breaking journey: This mission required an extensive knowledge base and multiple
        teams working in conjunction to bring this flight to fruition. The spacecraft was exceptionally complex, with
        multiple systems that were redundant, and required an extremely large portion of the schedule to be dedicated to
        testing. The Autonomy system had to be very robust as the mission is designed to have large periods of time
        where
        the spacecraft will be out of contact with the Earth. PSP was also mass constrained; all of the systems had to
        fit
        into a relatively small bus that restricted the integration order of operations and limited the amount of
        activities that could be performed in parallel. Due to these numerous challenges, the team had to be very
        flexible
        and adaptable to the needs of the spacecraft and the mission. From the integration of the bus at APL, to
        environmental testing at the Goddard Space Flight Center, to the final pre-flight processing at Astro-tech Space
        Operations and on the Delta IV Heavy launch vehicle at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, PSP was a learning
        experience every step of the way. In the end it was all worth it the time, the efforts, the capital, the
        resources
        every investment was worth it, we can clearly see the results now. Solar parker probe is truly a record breaking
        journey.</p>

      <h1>Major Leads/benefits of Solar parker probe:</h1>

      <p>Parker solar probe is returning a treasure trove of science data that will be analyzing for decades to come, it
        is a mission for the ages. It's helping us to know and study the facts about sun and how it influences the very
        nature of space Observations from helio-physics missions space whether events that can impact life and
        technology on earth and in space. It has also studied about the comets, detected radio emissions from Venus,
        atmosphere, and even captured the first ever image of Venus surface in visible wavelengths. With it's closet
        pass of the sun still ahead in 2024, only time will tell what new discoveries await.

        Complex engineering of parker solar probe: How did the parker solar probe not melt? The environment where parker
        solar probe was, was not very dense. It was able to survive the extreme temperature due to the thermal shield
        that is made of carbon composite material, with standing up to 2,500- degrees Fahrenheit or 1377 degree celcius.
        The parker solar pro has 7 sensor on outside to detect heat when it is not fully facing towards the sun. So, it
        can reorient. The instrument behind the serials are kept at 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Your play station may be more
        hotter.
